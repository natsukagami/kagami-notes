Just wanna say **Hello World** for my first blog after a very long break!

I really want to do this in all the languages I would like to write in.
So here it goes:

Chào trái đất!

Hello World!

世界へこんにちは！

\\[Hello World!\\]

```rust
println!("Hello World!")
```

Now I just realized that if I were to include programming languages, there 
would be many more.
I guess Rust is good for now.

See you next time!
